# university-scrapper
Scrapes the University of Basel market place page. So tired of constantly looking for the price of every WG and just have a page which can search by tags. 
Who developed this? Honestly who? I can make a better site. 

# Additional features:
- parse the date
- parse the key words in the url 
- look for words in the text and apply some sort of analysis
